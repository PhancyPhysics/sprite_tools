        Synopsis
        --------
        
        A Python package used to extract, create, and animate sprites. Here's an
        `example animation <https://youtu.be/KiZyHv39HqM>`__ using the animator
        module in this package.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        Animator Module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This module is a programmatic approach to creating and modifying frames
        for sprite animations. It is designed to be used along side existing
        image editing software to more efficiently create animation frames.
        Traditionally, sprite animations are created using image editing
        software such as GIMP or Paint.NET. Although this software comes with
        many tools and features to modify a single image, the workflow for image
        editing software is not optimized for making and saving incremental
        changes to an image needed for animation. For example, when using GIMP,
        the user must manually invoke the 'export' command and manually change
        the name of the image file to create a new frame. Additionally, sprites
        in GIMP must be pasted into their own layers for isolated sprite
        transformations such as translations or rotations. Creating and naming
        new image files, then creating and naming new layers, then pasting new
        sprites into layers, then navigating to other layers for additional
        sprite transformations or deletion leads to the user spending the
        majority of their time on the method of creating animation rather than
        the design of the animation. This module attempts to resolve these
        issues with the following features:
        
        -  **Implicit Frame Creation** -- Creating new animation frames does not
           require the user to explicitly name and initialize the frame. Saving
           a frame will automatically create a new frame to work on.
           Additionally, the dimensions of the frame will match the dimensions
           of the previous frame if they have the same background.
        
        -  **Entity-Event Based Sprite Expression** -- Related sprites are
           grouped as a single entity called a FrameElement. Specific sprites
           can be accessed through a FrameElement based on an event that happens
           to this entity and when the sprite occurs in the event. As an
           example, a collection of images depicting a cat would belong to the
           FrameElement of 'cat'. This collection of images can be subdivided
           based on what the cat is doing. Images depicting the cat while
           walking would be categorized under the 'walking' event. This grouping
           system is a more intuitive method of retrieving specific sprites than
           copying and pasting sprites from a sprite sheet through standard
           image editing software.
        
        -  **Automated Sprite Animation Looping** -- The user does not need to
           manually paste sprites for subsequent cycles of a looping sprite
           animation. Instead, the user defines the number of frames that a
           looping animation should occur in. This is useful for a FrameElement
           with a 'running' event animation.
        
        -  **Simplified Parametric Motion Execution** -- Parametric equations
           can be made within the script and its results can be applied directly
           to a FrameElement's positional data to create complex motion. The
           user does not need to know the explicit positional information of
           each sprite to accomplish motion.
        
        -  **Implementation of Other Basic Sprite Transforms** -- Sprites can be
           translated, rotated, flipped, scaled and given transparency without
           the need to create and save transformed versions of a sprite through
           image editing software. Parametric equations can also be used with
           these transforms for more complex transformations.
        
        Extractor Module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        (Extractor Module description to be added)
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Prerequisites
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Python Version: 2.7
        
        -  Module Dependencies: NumPy, openCV-python (cv2), SciPy, os, re
        
        Installing
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If the package is cloned from the Git repository or downloaded and
        extracted from GitHub, Use the terminal to navigate to the directory
        where the sprite\_tools folder was saved to. Give the setup.py script
        permission to execute and then install the sprite\_tools package to
        Python using the following terminal command:
        
        ::
        
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        If permission to write into the previous installation directory is
        denied, then try this terminal command:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install --user
        
        Although these commands are needed to use this package in any directory,
        running the setup.py script is not necessary to execute the example
        Cat\_Animation.py script.
        
        The package can also be installed with the following terminal command at
        the directory of the sprite\_tools folder:
        
        ::
        
            pip install sprite_tools
        
        If it is desired to install the package through the Python Package
        Index, then use the following terminal command (to be implemented)
        
        ::
        
            pip install sprite_tools
        
        Testing sprite\_tools Package
        -----------------------------
        
        Testing Animator Module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The animator module can be tested by running the Cat\_Animation.py
        script. After using the terminal to navigate to the Cat\_Animation
        script and giving the script execution permissions, run the following
        terminal command:
        
        ::
        
            ./cat_animation.py
        
        Note that this script will generate roughly 760 png images in the
        'Cat\_Animation\_Frames' folder. This should amount to roughly 30 Mb
        with an execution time of roughly 10 minutes depending on the computer.
        
        This script implements all user accessible animator methods to generate
        the png images stored in the Cat\_Animation\_Frames folder. A detailed
        explanation on how to use the features of the animator module can be
        viewed within the comments of the Cat\_Animation script. Additional
        details on method arguments and uses are found within the docstrings of
        the Animator module.

        Deployment
        ----------
        
        How to Use Animator Module Outputs
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The Animator module produces a png image sequence. It is recommended to
        use ffmpeg to use the image sequence to generate the movie file for best
        results. However other options are available such as Blender’s video
        editor or imagemagick's convert command for gif creation. Here is an
        example terminal command used to generate the movie file for the cat
        animation using the image sequence.
        
        ::
        
            ffmpeg -r 60 -f image2 -s 1920x1080 -i Frame_%03d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 25  -pix_fmt yuv420p Cat_Animation.mp4
        
        How to Use Extractor Module Outputs
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The extractor module is a loosely connected set of methods used to
        extract sprites from image files to generate assets for an animation. As
        a consequence of this, not all methods will need to be called to obtain
        sprites ready for use. Sprites created by the extractor module can be
        used by by the animator module methods given the correct directories.
